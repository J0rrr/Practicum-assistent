# Practicum-assistent
An app that assists in the grading of the practica of high-school students

## Introduction
In the physis classes I give to high-school students, we often do small experiments in the form of practica. Every trimester, a grade will be given to each student based on the seriousness in which they participate these practica. Currently, this grade is derived from my memory of how the practica went, but with multiple practica over a period of months with roughly a hundred students, deciding on this grade sometimes feels like guesswork. An app could help in documenting certain events (e.g. bad behaviour or good questions from students) during practica. This app could also grade the students in the end of every trimester, and the students can finally be handed out a detailed document on what their specific grade is based on. 

## Requirements
So what aspects are important for one such app? Firstly, it should be easy and quick to use. I myself, and teachers in general, do not have a lot of time during classes to fiddle with an app. Besides, it should be avoided that the teacher is 'constantly on his phone', while it is prohibited for the students to do so. So during the practica, a few buttonclicks should be enough to register certain student events.
